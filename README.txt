To run the source code:
1. Open or download the Processing IDE ( https://processing.org/download/ )
2. Load 'MyMusicMosaic.pde'. 
3. Press 'Run.'

Make sure a midi keyboard is plugged in to the computer and all drivers are installed.

If no keyboard is avaliable, an emulator may be used instead. VMPK along with loopMIDI work well.
